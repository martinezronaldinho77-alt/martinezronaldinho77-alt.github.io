# Ronaldinho Martinez's Portfolio

Hello, I am a electrical engineering major at CSUF and plan on graduating in 2029. Throughout my CPSC 120L course I feel I have learned a lot and would like to share those experiences. [Github Profile](https://github.com/martinezronaldinho77-alt)

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
 
* Lab 3, Part 1

    Lab 3 happened to be one of my favorite labs, as I found it somewhat fun. What made it fun for me was that I was creating something useful. In this lab, I created a way to program that calculates the Basal Metabolic Rate for men and women. This information is typically used by bodybuilders, pregnant women, or people who are dieting. I struggled a ton with the formatting in this lab and was just very confused on how to do it, but I still tried my best in it and learned a thing or two on how to improve the format a bit, as well as learned how to add equations during this lab, as we need one for calculating the BMR. My main problem with the formatting came from spacing and indenting, in which I kept using tabs but learned to do double spaces instead.

* Lab 5, part 1

    In this lab, I learned how to work with my teammates more. Specifically because for the first time, my teammates were cooperating and were pretty cool guys. They made the lab a lot of fun by actually talking and working with each other. Whenever I got stuck, one of them would come in and help me out, and we would take turns doing that. I feel that my teamwork skills really developed during this lab. Another great thing in this lab that I learned was defining functions by using the order Return type, Name, Parameters, then body. I also found it fun to work with multiple files, not entirely sure why I did, but it just made me feel like I was improving.	


* Lab 7, Part 1

    Out of all the labs, Lab 7 was my absolute favorite, and I feel like this lab made me improve the most. The lab was based on parking and what days you could not park on certain streets. Honestly, this lab was mostly fun to me because I have gotten a lot of parking tickets, so I was invested in figuring this code out. In this lab, I did most of the work myself, and I struggled a lot at times, but I asked the teachers for help, and they came to the rescue and showed me what my errors were and how I could fix and improve my work. I listened to them and found that my code ran much smoothly, and I imported the knowledge I learned that day into my future projects. I learned how to improve my loops by doing simpler code because at first, in my “for” loop, I kept writing down every day and time the street wasn’t available, and added too much code and making my code a lot longer than needed, but I learned to shorten it by simply just thinking more about it and realizing it would be shorter if I did the opposite on some of the codes and instead only putting the days parking was available my code would be significantly shorter.
