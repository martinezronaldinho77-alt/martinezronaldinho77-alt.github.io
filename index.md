Hello, I am a electrical engineering major at CSUF and plan on graduating in 2029.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
 
Lab 3, Part 1

Lab 3 happened to be one of my favorite labs as I found it somewhat fun. What I made it fun for me was that I was creating something useful. In this lab I created a way to program that calculates Basal Metabolic Rate for men and woman, This is information is typically used by body builders, pregnant, or people who are dieting. I struggle a ton with the formatting in this lab and was just very confused on how to do it but I still tried my best in it and learned a thing or two on how to improve the format a bit as well as I learned how to add equations during this lab as we need one for calculating the bmr.

Lab 5, part 1

In this lab I learned how to work with my teammates more. Specifically because for the first time my teammates were cooperating and were pretty cool guys. They made the lab a lot of fun by actually talking and working with each other. Whenever I got stuck, one of them would come in and help me out and we would take turns doing that. I feel that my team skills really developed during this lab.

Lab 7, Part 1

Out of all the labs, Lab 7 was my absolute favorite and I feel like this lab made me improve the most. The lab was based upon parking and what days you could not park on certain streets. Honestly this lab was mostly fun to me because I have gotten a lot of parking tickets so I was investing in figuring this code out. In this lab I did most of the work myself and I did struggle a lot at times but asked the teachers for help and they came to the rescue and showed me what my errors were and how I could fix and improve my work. I listened to them and found that my code ran much smoother and I imported the knowledge I learned that day into my future projects. I learned how to improve my loops and made my code a lot easier to read.
